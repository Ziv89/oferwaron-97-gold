      <h2>üìå Overview</h2>
      <p>
        OferWaron97%goldStrategy is an automated trading system built in <strong>Pine Script v5</strong> on the TradingView platform.  
        It is designed to deliver a strong statistical advantage in commodity trading, focusing on the two most volatile and profitable assets: <strong>Gold (XAU/USD)</strong> and <strong>Natural Gas (NG)</strong>.  
        The algorithm integrates dozens of technical indicators, advanced volatility calculations, and disciplined risk management.  
        It has a proven ability to create a positive income/expense ratio over time (Excel table included).
      </p>

      <h2>‚öôÔ∏è Core Operating Principles</h2>

      <h3>1. Multi-Layer Scoring System</h3>
      <p>
        At every point in time, the algorithm evaluates more than 10 technical parameters, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>MACD ‚Äì momentum and trend direction</li>
        <li>RSI / RMI ‚Äì trend strength and avoiding overbought/oversold zones</li>
        <li>ATR + SuperTrend ‚Äì volatility assessment and smart TP/SL limits</li>
        <li>EMA 21/50/100/200 ‚Äì multi-range trend filtering</li>
        <li>Stochastic, ROC, CCI ‚Äì additional momentum signals</li>
        <li>Volume Profile ‚Äì trade volume analysis for strong move validation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each indicator adds or subtracts points, leading to a final probability score (90‚Äì97%).  
        Only trades that meet the statistical threshold are executed.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Structured Risk Management</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Risk/Reward ratio: <strong>1:1 (50/50)</strong> for each trade</li>
        <li>Stop-Loss Cap: strict maximum loss limits, no breaches allowed</li>
        <li>Drawdown control: tracking winning/losing streaks in real time</li>
        <li>
          Realistic fees & taxes:  
          Net profit is calculated after 25% capital gains tax + ~3% broker fees (example: Israeli broker ‚Äú500 Plus‚Äù).  
          Effectively: 0.72% per trade expense and +1.03% on losses.
        </li>
        <li>Current average success rate: <strong>81%</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Recommended starting budget: ‚Ç™20,000 yearly (‚Ç™10,000 gold + ‚Ç™10,000 gas).  
        Profits above ‚Ç™10,000 are withdrawn; trading account is always reset to ‚Ç™10,000 at year-end.  
        Gold & gas both operate with 80% capital allocation and 40% per-trade risk.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Monitoring & Transparency</h3>
      <p>
        The system produces real-time performance reports, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Total number of trades</li>
        <li>Win/loss ratio</li>
        <li>Cumulative profit vs. loss</li>
        <li>Longest win/loss streaks</li>
        <li>Maximum drawdown from peak</li>
        <li>Visual tagging directly on the chart (WIN/LOSS markers)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Verification & Results</h3>
      <p>
        All results are based on <strong>comprehensive TradingView backtesting</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Uses real historical & updated market data</li>
        <li>Includes full fee & tax calculations</li>
        <li>No external manipulation ‚Äì results match TradingView reports</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. TradingView Integration</h3>

      </p>
      <ul>
